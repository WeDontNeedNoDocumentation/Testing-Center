USER MANUAL:

The Eclipse project is located in the src folder.  Normally once imported the server would be started
by running the main class. However for most of this submission we only have parts of each action functional so
the only way to run and test these parts is by running the "TestAppointments.java" test class. If Main is 
run, a text based interface will appear in the console. The user can adjust the number of seats in the testing
center and then the database will be updated from the 3 files provided(this will run for a few minutes and 
throw several error since the database has already been filled with these entries). We are sorry that there
is more that can be easily tested.

There is no client side at this time.
